		<h1> TUFFY IS ACTUALLY DHANUSH </h1>
		<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;"> Nibbles Mouse (also known as Tuffy Mouse) is a character from the Tom and Jerry cartoon series. He is the little grey, diaper-wearing orphan mouse. Nibbles has a fond taste for food, which can be a weakness as sometimes he forgets about escaping from foes and starts to search for his food.

In "The Two Mouseketeers," Nibbles makes a sandwich while singing "Alouette," which causes him to get caught by Monsieur Pussycat (Tom). But, if you look closer , Tuffy is actually Dhanush. Lot of characteristics are very similar for both. Tuffy is a nappy wearing mouse whereas Dhanush is a hat wearing guy. Tuffy is protected by Jerry. Meanwhile, Dhanush is protected by Ari. ( So , it is upto you to guess who is Jerry ). Tuffy has a fond taste for food
whereas Dhanush has a fond taste of books. Both guys are babies.(Dhanush appears as a baby for me)</p>

	<h1> TUFFY and JERRY ARE.... </h1>
	<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"> Tuffy is small and hungry forever. Dhanush is also always hungry to study. Dhanush with his brother , Mr.Ari are actually Tuffy and Jerry. Tuffy is always with Jerry just like Dhanush who stands with Ari even it is a success or a failure. In all kinda frustrated situations, Dhanush is like a medicine for ARI The Jerry.
	And that actually caused a pain in Jerry's heart that one day , Tuffy will be not with him but with a team of global experts. Although it is good to hear, it stings Jerry (Ari). The Innocence of Dhanush the Tuffy could be a factor that Jerry is with him. The appearance that shows Dhanush as an Ignorant one is quite dangerous forever. He knows a lot rather than Ari. </p>

	<h1> DBMS THE REVOLUTION </h1>
	<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"> Do you know ? DBMS is no longer called the Database Management System. Instead , due to the immensive growth in technology, it is upgraded to Dhanush Bharathi Management System. It is came to the act in a google meet , 2022. So, nowadays you can't ask a bookshop owner for Database Books, You must say "Dhanush Bharathi Books" so that you can buy it. For more techno updates, you must be a member of Tuffy Army.</p>
